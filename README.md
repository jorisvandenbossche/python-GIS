# Python for GIS workshop

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jorisvandenbossche/python-GIS/master?urlpath=lab)

Materials for workshop at Department of Environment, Ghent University.

Rendered version of the intro slides: https://jorisvandenbossche.github.io/python-GIS/slides.html#1

To run the demo notebooks, you can use the Binder link above to try them out in the cloud without the need to install any packages. Otherwise, I recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) to install the required packages (the `environment.yml` files contains a list with required packages for the demos).
